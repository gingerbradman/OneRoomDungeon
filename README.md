One Room Dungeon is a game about a mage trapped within a room. 
During experimentation, you developed an ability to rotate dimensional space but must have gotten something wrong!
Enemies begin pouring out of a rip in space, and reality rotates itself around you every 10 seconds!
Using your trusty fireball spell and your new manual rotation spell, defeat enemies your rip in space has created; and conquer the One Room Dungeon!
