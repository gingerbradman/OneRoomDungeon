# Introduction

Hello! My name is Gingerbrad and this is my entry for the 2021 July IndieTales Game Jam!
One Room Dungeon is a game built around the theme "One Room".

This game was built entirely by myself so I am credited for the art, music and code.
The above complies with the rules for the Game Jam.
I decided to make this repo public after revisiting and polishing the project after submission. 
No new content was created but bug fixes were implemented to create a smoother player experience.

# The Story

One Room Dungeon is a game about a mage trapped within a room. 
During experimentation, you developed an ability to rotate dimensional space but must have gotten something wrong!
Enemies begin pouring out of a rip in space, and reality rotates itself around you every 10 seconds!
Using your trusty fireball spell and your new manual rotation spell, defeat enemies your rip in space has created; and conquer the One Room Dungeon!
